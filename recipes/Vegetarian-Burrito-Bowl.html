    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p></p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Cauliflower.</li>
        <li>Bell peppers. We like to use a combo of red and green, jto make this burrito bowl as colorful as possible.</li>
        <li>Onions.</li>
        <li>Olive oil.</li>
        <li>Limes. You’ll need these for the burrito bowl toppings, and for the avocado crema (more on that later.)</li>
        <li>Taco seasoning. Homemade, or store bought in a pinch.</li>
        <li>Beans. Pinto or black—either work great.</li>
        <li>Jarred salsa. Or homemade! Whatever is easy—you’ll mostly be using this to flavor the beans.</li>
        <li>Romaine lettuce.</li>
        <li>Cilantro-lime rice. Of course, you can use plain or brown rice if that’s what you’ve got. 
            Or, you’ve got leftover rice, just jazz it up a little with some cilantro, lime juice and zest! Yum!</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>How To Make a Burrito Bowl</h2>
    <p>Making a burrito bowl is mostly an effort of assemblage. You can prep most of this bowl way ahead of time, too, and in doing so, make it a meal that comes together in minutes. Here’s how we like to approach this burrito bowl recipe:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Make the cilantro-lime rice. Burrito bowls are always a great use for leftover rice—either from takeout or from a homemade meal—so you can also just season some leftover rice with a little cilantro and lime juice.</li>
        <li>Roast the veggies! Roast cauliflower florets, peppers and onions—all seasoned with a little taco seasoning—for about 30 minutes. This can be done at least 2-3 days ahead of time, if you’re meal-prepping.</li>
        <li>Buckle up for one of our very best tips, ever! Season your beans by simmering them for a few minutes with some salsa. Voila! Instantly delicious beans! You could do this ahead, we supposed, but it takes only a couple minutes, and the burrito bowl is best if the beans are freshly warmed, so this is a step we reserve for the day-of.</li>
        <li>Avocado crema time! Mix this up while the beans simmer—yeah, it’s that fast to make.</li>
        <li>Assemble! Have everyone assemble their burrito bowls however they see fit, and ta da! A super-healthy dinner loaded with fiber, vitamins, and whole grains that everyone will love.</li>

    </ol>
